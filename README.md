# AWS Three Tier Web Architecture
# Description:
This project is a hands-on walkthrough of a three-tier web architecture in AWS. We will be manually creating the necessary network, security, app, and database components and configurations in order to run this architecture in an available and scalable manner.

# Tier Architecture explanation:
- **Web Server**: This is the front part of a web application that displays the website to users. It handles how the site looks and interacts with users, like showing product pages or allowing people to sign up.

- **Application Server**: This middle part manages the business logic and processes user actions. For example, it checks the inventory to see if a product is in stock or updates a user's account details.

- **Database Server**: This is the back-end part that stores all the data for the application. It uses databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL to keep track of information.
